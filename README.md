# Go project automation

Today, developers are under pressure to deliver software fast, reliable and frequently. The right tooling can help with boosting developer productivity dramatically. Join Benjamin Muschko to discuss what Go has to offer for package management, testing support, Continuous Integration, and IDE integration. You’ll leave with a good understanding on how to implement common automation tasks for Go projects to reduce your time to market.

In this course, you’ll learn how to improve software quality by analyzing your source code with the right tooling support and how to ensure reproducibility of your project by using proper package management. Ben will walk you through writing and executing tests to detect bugs before delivering the software to production. At the end of the training, we’ll set up a CI/CD pipeline that orchestrates the tooling into a fully automated process.

This class builds upon the knowledge gained in the training "Getting Started with Go." It’s also a great addition for any beginner or advanced Go programmer interested in getting to know the wider Go tooling ecosystem with the help of engaging hands-on exercises.

## Prerequisites

All exercises are based on a sample Go project. Please make sure to follow the [instructions](./prerequisites/instructions.md) for setting up the sample project before joining the training.

## Exercises

All exercises are numbered and live in dedicated directories starting with the name `exercise-`. You'll find instructions for each exercise in each folder. Solutions are available in the `solution` folder. Try to solve each exercise yourself before having a look at the solution.
